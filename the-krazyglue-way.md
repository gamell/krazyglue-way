The secret ingredient :speak_no_evil:...

# Our Culture

-------

## We share a common goal

> Ship quality code often that meets our customers' expectations and be better every day.

-------

## We respect each other and treat others as equals
- We **listen** when others talk
- We are **open** to others' **opinions**
- We don't waste people's **time**
- We put the team's interest before our own
- We take decisions through **consensus**

-------

## We strive to be better everyday: Continuous Improvement
- Everyone makes mistakes. Let's **learn** from them
- Understand the root of the issue. **We ask *Why***, not *Who*.
- We are expected to **call out** anything that can be better / improved
- We **learn** new things & new technologies and **share** with the others

-------

## We are biased towards action
- Avoid *Planning paralysis*
- Do :arrow_right: Measure :arrow_right: Keep / Rollback :arrow_right: Iterate!
- Estimations and plans will always be wrong anyway
- :-1: Big, costly changes
- :+1: Small, incremental, measurable changes
- **Start small**: easy to get the ball rolling

-------

## We are all owners
- We set a **high bar** for ourselves and the team
- We are **not** defined by our HR role
- We wear **many hats**: I am a Manager / Leader / TPM / Front end developer / QA / Product Manager
- Whoever is "*closer to the problem*" is enabled to **take decisions** (with some exceptions)

-------

## We are close to the customer
- Everyone of us is able to **interact with product directly** for whatever we need
- We **understand** the product
- We know **why** we are doing the task we've been asked to
- We **pitch** new product ideas

-------

## We remove waste & overhead
- Communicate directly with the best person to solve the problem at hand (intra and inter team)
- Done > Perfect
- `JIT`

-------

# We have fun :japanese_ogre:

-------

# Technical principles

-------

## Clean code*

- Writing code for machines is easy, writing for humans is harder
- We write **maintainable**, **readable** code
- We do **pair coding**
- We **review each others'** code

`*` Get Clean Code Book [here](https://goo.gl/L2gFz5).

-------

## KISS

- We all love to over-engineer solutions, watch out!
- Universal truth: **`Less code` :arrow_right: `Less bugs`**

-------

## Continuous Delivery & Deployment

- ~Kanban system
- Fast feedback cycle
- JIT bug fixes
- Everyone is able to deploy (even TPMs!)
- ***Ship it!*** by default - and rollback if necessary.

-------

## :oncoming_bus: Bus Factor / Jacks of all trades

- Avoid concentration of knowledge in a single team member
- We all: know **front-end** & **back-end**, **deploy**, **monitor** and rotate **on call**.
- Share knowledge in our "Clean code" Sessions
- Documentation, documentation, documentation

-------

## If it hurts, do it more often (until it gets better)

- "BOM version upgrades are super painful" - *Cool, let's do them every week*
- "Deployment scripts are becoming unreliable" - *Great, let's deploy to prod manually every day*

-------

## "Clean while you cook"

- Write a test for the bug you fix
- Consider refactoring before building that new feature
- No one wants a massive pile of tech debt to "clean", we prevent it from building up
- Leave the code better than you found it

-------

# Automation & Redundancy everywhere

- Reduce human mistakes
- Humans fail, but sometimes machines do too :arrow_right: redundant solutions

-------

# Team Leadership

-------

## Our managers are

- Mentors
- Facilitators & *unblockers*
- Escalation paths, when necessary

-------

## Management smells

- If the manager always plays the Technical Expert role (exceptions apply)
- If the managers are the sole decision makers
- If management is the single point of failure
- If management is single node where all communications flow through

--------

We talked a lot about krazyglue culture, but...
# What do *YOU* value?
